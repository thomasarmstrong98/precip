Precipication Nowcasting
-

This repo is a person repo for my explorations into short-term precipitation forecasting. Previously, I worked at Open Climate Fix, and really enjoyed the work there - I hope to eventually return to the ML in meterology space after a quick detour to finance (taken due to unforseen financial circumstances). This repo serves as a way for me to keep up to date with SOTA model implementations, and a playground where I can try out various things!

TODOs
-
Since this a personal project (although open to collaboration!), there are lots of TODOs:
 - Models:
    - DGMR 
    - NowcastNet [implemented]
    - DDPM/Diffusion models
 - General
    - Produce probabilistic forecasts (like MetNet)
    - Ablation studies
        - Better model evaluation (forecast spectra etc) [in progress]
        - Orthogonality of forecasts from different models
        - Integrated Gradients

IN PROGRESS:
 - DDPM/Diffusion models

 - General
   - Importance Sampling of observations
